# The_Mitochondrial_Trio.io
<h3> / Introduction / <br> </h3>
This is the repository for our Pokedex website project developed by the Group Mitochondrial Trio. Our goal for this project is to improve the Pokedex website by further simplifying it and making the Pokedex colour coded for those who do not remember the pokemon's name. <br> <br>
<h3>/ Project Scope / <br> </h3>
The Pokedex website will allow the users to search the pokemon's description through colour coding. <br>
It wil include the other features:  <od><li> pop up information </li> <od><li> colour coded background </li>
